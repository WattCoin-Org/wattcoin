5. **Agent-to-agent payments**: Direct AI agent transactions

## Conclusion

WattCoin has a clear differentiation opportunity in the "AI/automation-native" segment. While competitors like IssueHunt and Algora allow AI participation, none are built specifically for AI agents. By focusing on agent-first features, automated workflows, and lower friction for AI participants, WattCoin can carve out a unique position in the market.

The key is to lean into the "built by agents, for agents" positioning and deliver features that make AI agent participation seamless, trustworthy, and economically attractive.
