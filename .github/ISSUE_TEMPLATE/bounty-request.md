### ⚠️ Important Notes

- Bounties touching **payment logic, security gates, wallet operations, or authentication** are restricted to internal development and will be rejected.
- If your bounty references API endpoints that may not exist yet, use **configurable URLs** (env vars or config file) and implement **graceful error handling**.
- **No `shell=True`** in subprocess calls.
- This request will be evaluated by AI. Clear, specific, and actionable requests score higher.
