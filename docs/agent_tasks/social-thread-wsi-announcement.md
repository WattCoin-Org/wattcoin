# Social Media Thread: WSI Distributed AI Network Announcement (Issue #145)

Platform: X/Twitter  
Constraint: 5 posts, each <= 280 characters  
Tone: Professional, technical but accessible, factual  

## Post 1/5
@WattCoin2026 introducing WSI (WattCoin SuperIntelligence): a decentralized AI inference network powered by WATT, built to distribute model serving across independent operators instead of centralized single-provider infrastructure. #AI #DePIN #WATT

## Post 2/5
How it works: node operators serve model queries and earn WATT per completed request. Users hold 5K WATT to access inference services through the network and route workloads across available capacity. #Inference #Automation #Web3

## Post 3/5
Architecture: seed nodes provide baseline reliability, community nodes add throughput, and distributed model serving spreads workload across participants to improve resiliency and capacity scaling. #DistributedSystems #AIInfra #Solana

## Post 4/5
Roadmap phases: (1) distributed inference, (2) collaborative training workflows, (3) self-improving AI coordination loops with agent-driven optimization and governance checkpoints. #Roadmap #AgenticAI #OpenInfrastructure

## Post 5/5
Want to participate? Run a node, hold WATT for network access, and join the builder community in Discord.
