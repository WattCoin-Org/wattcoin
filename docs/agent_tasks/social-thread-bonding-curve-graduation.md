## Post 1/5
@WattCoin2026 milestone update: WATT has graduated from the pump.fun bonding curve stage to Raydium DEX liquidity. This marks a transition from launch-phase discovery into broader open-market access. #Solana #DeFi #WATT

## Post 2/5
What this means: deeper liquidity, wider trading access, and stronger market infrastructure for participants using WATT in real workflows. It is a maturity step for long-term ecosystem operations. #Raydium #CryptoInfrastructure

## Post 3/5
What drove graduation: organic participation plus utility across bounties, SwarmSolve software tasks, and WSI roadmap execution. Usage came first, then liquidity depth followed. #UtilityToken #BuildInPublic #Automation

## Post 4/5
What is next: continued rollout of WSI distributed inference and expansion of the node network so contributors can serve workloads and earn through execution. #AIInfra #DistributedSystems #Web3
